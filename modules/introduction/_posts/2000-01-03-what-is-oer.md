title: What is OER?

# OER defined

There are many definitions of OER out there. We like the one from [UNESCO:](https://en.unesco.org/themes/building-knowledge-societies/oer)

Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning and research materials in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions. 

The three primary characteristics that make OER different from other educational resources are that it is **free, available online,** and **openly licensed.**

## Free

Although OER is not free to create (writing OER is hard work!), true OER are licensed in ways that permit no-cost access, no matter who you are or where you live. In order to be considered OER, the resource must be licensed in a way that allows for the 5R activities. Open Education advocate [David Wiley describes them this way:](http://opencontent.org/definition/)

- Retain - make, own, and control a copy of the resource (e.g., download and keep your own copy)
- Revise - edit, adapt, and modify your copy of the resource (e.g., translate into another language)
- Remix - combine your original or revised copy of the resource with other existing material to create something new (e.g., make a mashup)
- Reuse - use your original, revised, or remixed copy of the resource publicly (e.g., on a website, in a presentation, in a class)
- Redistribute - share copies of your original, revised, or remixed copy of the resource with others (e.g., post a copy online or give one to a friend)

As you explore educational content, you may come across individuals, companies, or organizations claiming to provide OER while maintaining propietary practices. An exmaple of this is an "OER" package from a commercial publisher that requires payment for components of the content. The practice of labeling content as "open" when it is not fully open is known as [open washing](https://openwashing.org/).

If you're not sure whether the resources you want to use are open, check for a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), or [contact the libraries](mailto:lauren.mckeen@northwestern.edu) for assistance.

## Online

The web has enabled us to create and share content like never before. This capability has led to the [open movement,](https://creativecommons.org/2018/09/18/traditional-knowledge-and-the-commons-the-open-movement-listening-and-learning/) which encompases OER, open source software, open access journals, open data, and more. At the heart of it is the ability to share knowledge without access barriers or technological restrictions. 

While all OER starts online, it doesn't have to stay online! OER comes in file formats that can be easily printed at a fraction of the cost of commercial course materials. The libraries can work with you to print your OER at cost, or to set up an online ordering mechanism so your students can easily order a print copy of their OER textbook for themselves.

## Openly Licensed

Any time you create something in a tangible medium, you own the copyright to it. As the copyright holder, you have exclusive rights to share, distribute, perform, display, and create derivatives of your own work. If you want to allow others to legally perform the same actions that you can as the copyright holder, while still receiving credit for your work, you can give your creation an open license. Open licenses work in conjunction with copyright and offer varying levels of openness depending on the license chosen. 

The most widely used form of open licenses are provided by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/). Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization "dedicated to building a globally-accessible public commons of knowledge and culture." Since their licenses are used globally, they provide a standardized way to share knowledge and resources globally.

In the next section, we'll go into detail about the different types of licenses and how or why you might use them.
