# Learning Objectives

Following the completion of this course, you will be able to:

 - define Open Educational Resources (OER) and see OER as an alternative to commercial course materials.
 - understand options and support available for finding, using, and developing OER at Northwestern University. 
 - identify resources for finding and using OER within your discipline, and feel comfortable incorporating them into your course.
 - connect with a librarian who can partner with you to explore alternative course materials.

Up next, we'll learn more about why the open education movement matters, and how teaching with OER can impact students at Northwestern and beyond.
