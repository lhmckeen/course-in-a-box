## How do students get textbooks?

- Northwestern Bookstore
- Amazon or other online retailers
- Rent used copies
- Share with friends
- Find illegally pirated copies online

In a recent survey, **45% of Northwestern students** have reported trying to get by without the textbook. Imagine if nearly half of your class completed your course without opening the required textbook! That would surely impact your ability to teach and their ability to learn.
