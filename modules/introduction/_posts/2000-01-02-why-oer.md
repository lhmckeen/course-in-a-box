## How do students get textbooks?

- Northwestern Bookstore
- Amazon or other online retailers
- Rent used copies
- Share with friends
- Find illegally pirated copies online

In a recent survey, **45% of Northwestern students** have reported trying to get by without the textbook. Imagine if nearly half of your class completed your course without opening the required textbook! That would surely impact student outcomes.

## The Solution: OER

OER are free teaching materials that are licensed for unrestricted distribution and modification to fit the course-specific needs of instructors.

In addition to being free to students, OER has a wide range of benefits:

- Available on the first day of class
- Can be accessed digitally or printed 
- Promotes diversity and inclusion when paired with open pedagogy
- Openly licensed means greater control over course content
- Provides opportunities to explore innovative teaching practices
- Provides opportunities to contribute to scholarship that will be shared and used globally

In the next section, we'll cover what makes OER "open" and what that means for OER creators and consumers.
