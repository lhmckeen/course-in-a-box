## Free, Digital, and Adaptable: Finding and Using OER in Your Course

Open Educational Resources (OER) are free teaching and learning materials that allow instructors to modify, adapt, and reuse content for academic purposes. 

While traditional copyright and licensing practices for commercial textbooks create barriers to student access, OER guarantees that students can access high-quality, customized course materials on the first day of class. In this course we will share about the many benefits of using OER, highlight resources for finding and using OER across disciplines, and explore ideas for engaging students in the knowledge creation process through open pedagogy.

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:
-Define Open Educational Resources, and see OER as an alternative to traditional textbooks for courses.
-Understand options and support available for using, developing, and teaching with OER.
-Identify resources for finding and using OER within your discipline.
-Connect with librarians who can partner with you to explore alternative course materials using OER and library materials.
